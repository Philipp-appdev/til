The most important git commands are:
- Git checkout - b <name-of-branch> - creates new branch
- Git checkout <name-of-branch> - switches to existing branch 
- Git add -A - adds all changes to staging area
- Git commit -a -m - commits all additions and modifications
- Git push - pushes commited changes to github
