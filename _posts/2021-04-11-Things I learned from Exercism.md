- default arguments are set by def/method(argument = "default value")/end
- Array of strings can be converted into an array of integers with: array.map(&:to_i)
- Looping through an array with: array.each do |i| /end
- Regular expression (regex) can be used to split a string e.g. along everything that is not a letter of the alphabet: .split(/[^a-zA-Z]/)
