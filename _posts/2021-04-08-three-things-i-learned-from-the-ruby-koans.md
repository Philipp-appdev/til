title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
- assert_equal test passes if the two inputs are identical.
- assert_raise test passes if the expected exception occurs.
- Begin, rescue, end structure can be used to prevent program from crashing when an error occurs under certain circumstance that are known and should not cause the program to crash.
